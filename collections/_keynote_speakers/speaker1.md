bio:
    is University Professor for High Performance Computing Systems at the Institute of Information Systems Engineering, Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) where she leads the High Performance Computing Systems Research Group. In 2015 she was awarded the FWF START prize, the highest Austrian award for early career researchers. Since 2016 she has been a member of the Young Academy of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. She received her PhD degree in 2007 and her venia docendi for practical computer science in 2013, both from Vienna University of Technology. From 2009 to 2012 she led the Austrian national FoSII (Foundations of Self-governing ICT Infrastructures) project funded by the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF). She was a management committee member of the European Commission's COST Action on Energy Efficient Large Scale Distributed Systems and of the COST Action on Sustainable Ultrascale Computing (NESUS). I. Brandic was on the Editorial Board of IEEE Magazine on Cloud Computing, IEEE TPDS and IEEE TCC. In 2011 she received the Distinguished Young Scientist Award from the Vienna University of Technology for her project on the Holistic Energy Efficient Hybrid Clouds. Her interests comprise virtualized HPC systems, energy efficient ultra-scale distributed systems, massive-scale data analytics, Cloud \& workflow Quality of Service (QoS), and service-oriented distributed systems. She published more than 50 scientific journal, magazine and conference publications and she co-authored a text-book on federated and self-manageable Cloud infrastructures.

# Talk
keynote_date: "Wednesday, October 18th — 11:00"
keynote_room: "TBD"
keynote_title: Benchmarking of Hybrid Computational Continuum
keynote_abstract:
    Real life applications can be executed on devices that range in size from smartphones to warehouse size data centers. Meanwhile, architectures are becoming heterogeneous including various accelerators and even non von Neumann computers into the computational continuum. In this talk we discuss challenges when benchmarking different types of applications on a hybrid computational continuum. First, we present the methods for decomposition and execution of HPC applications on hybrid Classic/Quantum systems. Second, we discuss the benefits but also problems and challenges when executing applications of hybrid systems. Third, we revisit the current state of the art testbeds for the execution and benchmarking of hybrid classic/quantum.
