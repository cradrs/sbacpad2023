bio:
    Bronson Messer is a Distinguished Scientist and Director of Science at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) at ORNL. Messer has been developing code for, helping to design, and developing useful requirements for some of the world’s largest supercomputers for more than two decades. He is also a Joint Faculty Associate Professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Tennessee. His primary research interests are related to the explosion mechanisms and phenomenology of supernovae (both thermonuclear and core-collapse), especially neutrino transport and signatures, dense matter physics, and the details of turbulent nuclear combustion.

# Talk
keynote_date: "Thursday, October 19th — 11:00"
keynote_room: "Theather"
keynote_title: "Frontier: The World’s Most Powerful Computer for Science"
keynote_abstract:
    The first exascale computer, called Frontier, has been delivered to Oak Ridge National Laboratory this past year. This unique scientific instrument is the culmination of more than a decade of concerted effort. I will relate a bit of the history of hybrid-node computing at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) and how Frontier represents the latest iteration of that approach. Some details of Frontier’s architecture will be discussed, including an overview of the new AMD GPUs that provide the bulk of the computational power for Frontier. Finally, we will take a look at some problems that will benefit from the increased capability at exascale and I will convey some lesson learned from trying to get the applications attacking these problems running on this machine.
