<h1>Call for Papers</h1>
<p>The <strong>IEEE 35th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing (SBAC-PAD 2023)</strong> will take place from <strong>October 17th</strong> to <strong>20th, 2023</strong>, in <strong>Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>SBAC-PAD</strong> is an annual international conference series, which presents the latest trends, current research and developments, and novel tools and applications in the fields of Computer Architecture, High-Performance Computing, and Parallel and Distributed Computing technologies. SBAC-PAD is open to industry, faculty, researchers, practitioners, and undergraduate and graduate students from around the world. Its scientific program is composed of high-quality submitted papers, selected by a thorough peer review process, and invited talks from renowned researchers. </p>

<p>The program committee will select the top-ranked papers as finalists, and one paper will be selected during the conference as the Best Paper. Selected papers will also be invited to submit an extended version to a special issue of the <strong>Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing</strong>.</p>

<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
<p>
    Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts to one of five tracks that address challenges in any of the following areas related to the fields of Computer Architecture (CA) and High-performance and Distributed Computing (HPDC). Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    <li>Benchmarking, performance modeling, analysis, and evaluation; </li>
    <li>Blockchain and distributed ledgers;</li>
    <li>Cloud, cluster, and edge/fog computing systems;</li>
    <li>Data-intensive workloads and tools;</li>
    <li>Data management, storage, and I/O;</li>
    <li>Embedded and pervasive systems;</li>
    <li>GPUs, FPGAs, and accelerator architectures;</li>
    <li>Languages, compilers, and tools for parallel and distributed programming;</li>
    <li>Modeling and simulation methodologies;</li>
    <li>Operating systems and virtualization;</li>
    <li>Parallel and distributed systems, algorithms, models, and applications;</li>
    <li>Power and energy-efficient systems;</li>
    <li>Predictive models to improve performance of scientific applications</li>
    <li>Processing-in-memory or near-data processing technologies</li>
    <li>Processor, cache, memory, storage, and network architecture;</li>
    <li>Quantum computing in CA and HPDC;</li>
    <li>Real-world applications and case studies;</li>
    <li>Reconfigurable, resilient, and fault-tolerant systems;</li>
    <li>Security and privacy in CA and HPDC;</li>
    <li>Workflow systems.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Paper submission</h3>

<p>Papers submitted to SBAC-PAD 2023 must present original research results and must not have been published or concurrently be submitted anywhere else. Submissions should be made via the Easy Chair system using the submission link:</p>
<p><a href='https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sbacpad2023' target='_blank' class='url'>https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sbacpad2023</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paper submissions must be in English, have 10 pages maximum (excluding the references), and follow the IEEE conference manuscript formatting guidelines for double-column text using a single-spaced 10-point font on 8.5 × 11-inch pages. Templates are available from <a href='http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html'>http://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>. Papers that do not meet these requirements might be rejected without a review. To be published in the conference proceedings and to be eligible for publication at the IEEE Xplore, one of the authors must register at the full rate and present his/her work at the conference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The SBAC-PAD 2023 submissions will undergo a <b>double-anonymized review process</b>, where reviewers will not know the authors&#39; identities, and vice-versa. Therefore, authors should “anonymize” their submission by adopting the following guidelines, otherwise papers will be rejected without review:</p>
<ul>
<li>The authors cannot include their names, affiliations, funding sources, or acknowledgments in any part of the for-review version of their paper;</li>
<li>Self-references that are relevant to the work are allowed, but they should not appear in the text in the first person. Instead, they should be referenced in the third person, like “Smith et al. found that… [4].”, and;</li>
<li>For the authors' own unpublished work, they need to use anonymous citations.</li>
</ul>
