  <h2><b>Title: Pairwise, Structural and Multiple Biological Sequence Comparison in HPC Platforms: the Quest for the Optimal Solution</b></h2>
  
  <h3><b>Abstract:</b> Biological sequence comparison is an important problem in Bioinformatics and its goal is to define how similar the
    sequences are, producing a score, and highlighting their similarities, producing an alignment. There are many ways to compare 
    biological sequences and all of them require high performance computing solutions, when the optimal solution is needed. In this talk, 
    we will deal with three types of sequence comparison. First, we discuss pairwise sequence comparison, which is often solved with 
    dynamic programming using variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, producing the optimal solution with time complexity O(n^2), 
    where n is the length of the sequences. We present our MASA tools, which can be used in CPU or GPU to pairwise compare 
    long DNA sequences. The last version of MASA for GPUs (MASA-CUDAlign-MultiBP) attained the best performance in the literature in 2021. 
    Then, we examine the structural RNA alignment problem, that is also solved with dynamic programming, using the Sankoff algorithm, 
    with time complexity O(n^6). We present our CUDA-Sankoff tool and show that it has very good speedups. Next, we discuss the multiple 
    sequence alignment (MSA) problem, which is proven NP-Complete. We present our PA-Star CPU-based tool, which executes a variant of 
    the A-Star algorithm to compute the optimal MSA. We show that PA-Star is able to compare multiple sequences in reduced time, when 
    compared to the literature. At the end of the talk, we will do a covid-19 case study, showing how our three tools are used to 
    compare SARS-CoV-2 sequences.</h3>

<h2><b>Title: Frontier: The World’s Most Powerful Computer for Science</b></h2>
  
  <h3><b>Abstract:</b> The first exascale computer, called Frontier, has been delivered to Oak Ridge National Laboratory this past year. 
    This unique scientific instrument is the culmination of more than a decade of concerted effort. I will relate a bit of the 
    history of hybrid-node computing at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) and how Frontier represents the latest 
    iteration of that approach. Some details of Frontier’s architecture will be discussed, including an overview of the new AMD GPUs 
    that provide the bulk of the computational power for Frontier. Finally, we will take a look at some problems that will benefit 
    from the increased capability at exascale and I will convey some lesson learned from trying to get the applications attacking 
    these problems running on this machine.</h3>
  
  <h3><b>Bio:</b> Bronson Messer is a Distinguished Scientist and Director of Science at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility 
    (OLCF) at ORNL. Messer has been developing code for, helping to design, and developing useful requirements for some of the world’s 
    largest supercomputers for more than two decades.  He is also a Joint Faculty Associate Professor in the Department of Physics & 
    Astronomy at the University of Tennessee. His primary research interests are related to the explosion mechanisms and phenomenology 
    of supernovae (both thermonuclear and core-collapse), especially neutrino transport and signatures, dense matter physics, and the 
    details of turbulent nuclear combustion.</h3>

  <h2><b>Title: Benchmarking of Hybrid Computational Continuum</b></h2>
  
  <h3><b>Abstract:</b> Real life applications can be executed on devices that range in size from smartphones to warehouse size data 
    centers. Meanwhile, architectures are becoming heterogeneous including various accelerators and even non von Neumann computers 
    into the computational continuum. In this talk we discuss challenges when benchmarking different types of applications on a 
    hybrid computational continuum. First, we present the methods for decomposition and execution of HPC applications on hybrid 
    Classic/Quantum systems. Second, we discuss the benefits but also problems and challenges when executing applications of 
    hybrid systems. Third, we revisit the current state of the art testbeds for the execution and benchmarking of hybrid 
    classic/quantum.</h3>
