            <h1>Call for Workshop Proposals</h1>

            <p>Workshops should provide forums for discussion among researchers and practitioners on focused topics or research areas relevant to the community of Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing. This year's edition has special interest on emerging topics such as the use of HPC for healthcare, genomics and life sciences applications; big data management; energy- and thermal-aware HPC systems; software quality for ensuring reliability and correctness of HPC applications; development of “thinking”’ computer systems; flexible and scalable HPC solutions; and heterogeneous/collaborative computing.</p>

            <p>Organizers may structure workshops as they see fit, including invited talks, panel discussions, presentations of work in progress, fully peer-reviewed papers, or some combination of the above. Workshops could be scheduled for half a day or a full day. </p>
            
            <p>The peer-reviewed accepted papers of organized workshops will be published in the SBAC-PAD proceedings and will be available online in the IEEE Xplore digital library. Each paper must have at least three reviews for being eligible for publication.</p>
